# TestNeo MCP — Web AI Assistant & prompt library

**Purpose:** Publish-ready guide for using **`testneo_ai_assistant_query`** from MCP (same backend as the product **Web AI Assistant** at **`/web/ai-assistant`**) plus copy-paste **prompts** for document Q&A, analytics, and persona-driven release reviews.

**Canonical location:** `docs/mcp/mcp-ai-assistant-and-prompts.md` in the TestNeo API monorepo.  
**Related:** [MCP tool reference](./MCP_TOOL_REFERENCE.md) · Quickstart, prompt packs, and context discovery: [testneo.ai — MCP docs](https://testneo.ai/docs/testneo-mcp.html)

## What `testneo_ai_assistant_query` does

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Backend** | `POST /api/web/v1/etl/ai-assistant/query` (same as the browser UI) |
| **Auth** | Uses your **`TESTNEO_API_KEY`** (MCP server) — same account as the app |
| **Quota** | Counts against **Web AI chat** limits (see response **`usage`**) |
| **Timeout** | Long LLM budget via **`TESTNEO_MCP_SWAGGER_TIMEOUT_MS`** (default **120000** ms) on the MCP server |

**Without** `context_id` / `context_name_query`, the assistant uses **project-wide analytics** context (similar to choosing a project but no document in the UI).  
**With** `context_id` **or** `context_name_query`, answers are **scoped to that unified context** (Figma/PDF/requirements ingest).

## Tool parameters (MCP)

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **`project_id`** | Yes | Web automation project id |
| **`query`** | Yes | Natural-language question (up to **32000** characters) |
| **`context_id`** | No | Numeric unified context id |
| **`context_name_query`** | No | Human label fragment (e.g. `"Figma"`, `"figma checkout"`). MCP resolves via the same rules as **`testneo_get_unified_context_by_name`**. Do not pass both **`context_id`** and **`context_name_query`** unless you intend **`context_id`** to win. |
| **`context_match_mode`** | No | `auto` (default) \| `exact` \| `substring` |
| **`prefer_context_id`** | No | Disambiguate when several contexts match |
| **`response_style`** | No | `concise` \| `detailed` (matches UI styles) |
| **`recommend_context`** | No | Optional JSON object — **AI-Q** / recommendation payload (advanced; same idea as web body) |
| **`rag_context`** | No | Optional JSON object — document-aware RAG controls (advanced; same idea as web body) |

## Response shape (`testneo_mcp_ai_assistant.v1`)

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **`assistant_reply`** | Main answer text for chat / stakeholders |
| **`context_id`** | Resolved context id, or **`null`** for project-wide |
| **`context_resolution`** | When **`context_name_query`** was used: match hint, ambiguity candidates, or error **`context_not_resolved`** |
| **`product_navigation.web_ai_assistant_url`** | Link to **`…/web/ai-assistant`** (respects **`TESTNEO_WEB_APP_URL`** in MCP) |
| **`usage`** | Web AI quota snapshot when returned by API |
| **`upstream`** | Full API JSON for debugging / advanced agents |

---

## Data-backed release reviews (recommended pattern)

The assistant may summarize **execution** or **requirements** using **project analytics** context. **Execution counts and pass rates** can differ between **analytics** and **workflow** endpoints depending on how much history exists — for **go / no-go** decisions, combine tools:

1. **`testneo_run_agent_workflow`** with **`workflow_type`: `"qa_intelligence_workflow"`** — structured failures, triage bundles, rerun preview.  
2. Optionally **`testneo_get_pass_fail_trend`**, **`testneo_list_recent_executions`**, **`testneo_search_failures`**.  
3. **`testneo_ai_assistant_query`** with **no** context (or with context) and a prompt such as:  
   *“Synthesize the following JSON into a one-page executive memo. Do not invent metrics not present in the payload.”*  
   (Paste compact JSON from step 1–2.)

That pattern is stronger than “chat with PDF only” products: **ground truth from TestNeo** + **narrative** from the assistant.

## Copy-paste prompts — document / unified context

Use **`context_name_query`** (or **`context_id`**) + **`response_style`: `"detailed"`** unless you want short bullets.

**Ambiguity and PM clarifications**

```text
List ambiguous or conflicting requirements in this context. For each, quote the shortest supporting phrase and propose one clarification question for the PM.
```

**Deep summary + test ideas**

```text
Summarize what this context contains (sources, main flows, and any risks). Then list 5 concrete test ideas we should automate first.
```

**Negative tests (concise, one line each)**

```text
Propose 8 negative tests a human would catch that happy-path automation usually misses. One line each.
```

**Traceability (conceptual)**

```text
Build a traceability sketch: requirements → implied user journeys → suggested test themes (conceptual only, no execution IDs).
```

**Edge cases for a flow (edit the area name)**

```text
For checkout and payment, what are the top 8 edge cases this context supports versus what is not specified?
```

---

## Copy-paste prompts — project analytics (no context)

Omit **`context_id`** and **`context_name_query`**. Use **`response_style`: `"detailed"`** for memos.

**Release readiness (four sections)**

```text
Act as a release readiness reviewer. Summarize quality risk in 4 sections: (1) trend of failures vs passes if you have execution context, (2) top 3 risk themes, (3) go / no-go / go-with-conditions with explicit conditions, (4) next 5 actions for QA and Eng. If you lack execution facts, say exactly what is missing.
```

**Executive health (short)**

```text
Give an executive summary of test health for this project in under 200 words. Explicitly list what data you used and what is missing.
```

## Persona packs (same tool; tune the `query`)

Replace **`<PROJECT_ID>`** in MCP calls. Add **`context_name_query`** when the persona should read a specific document context.

### Engineering / QA manager

- “**Can we release this week?** Give **go / no-go / go-with-conditions** and **three measurable** exit criteria.”  
- “If we slip one week, what **quality debt** do we pay — rank by severity.”  
- “Draft a **150-word stakeholder email**: current quality story + **one** decision you need from leadership.”

### QA lead

- “Propose a **7-day test plan** for release: goals, scope, environments, **exit criteria**.”  
- “Which **failure modes** should we target first — rank by **customer impact × likelihood × cost to verify** (qualitative is fine).”  
- “What should **daily standup** ask about quality this week?”

### Developer

- “What **highest-leverage** tests should we add before we refactor `<area>` — avoid overlapping existing coverage.”  
- “List **observable assertions** that belong in UI tests vs API-only checks for the same flows.”

### Product / program

- “**Scope-risk review:** what did we promise in the requirements that is **hard to verify** automatically?”  
- “**Launch checklist** beyond ‘all tests green’ — what must be true for support and sales?”

### Security / privacy (document-heavy contexts)

- “From this context, list **PII touchpoints** and **trust boundaries**; what tests prove we do not leak data across boundaries?”

## Example MCP tool arguments (JSON)

**Scoped to a context by name**

```json
{
  "project_id": 49,
  "context_name_query": "Figma",
  "context_match_mode": "auto",
  "response_style": "detailed",
  "query": "Summarize what this context contains (sources, main flows, and any risks). Then list 5 concrete test ideas we should automate first."
}
```

**Project-wide analytics**

```json
{
  "project_id": 49,
  "response_style": "detailed",
  "query": "Act as a release readiness reviewer. Summarize quality risk in 4 sections: (1) trend of failures vs passes if you have execution context, (2) top 3 risk themes, (3) go / no-go / go-with-conditions with explicit conditions, (4) next 5 actions for QA and Eng. If you lack execution facts, say exactly what is missing."
}
```

**Pinned context id** (when you already resolved id **106**, for example)

```json
{
  "project_id": 49,
  "context_id": 106,
  "response_style": "concise",
  "query": "Propose 8 negative tests a human would catch that happy-path automation usually misses. One line each."
}
```

## Prerequisites and limits

- **Feature access:** Account must have **Web AI Assistant** entitlement (same as UI).  
- **Subscription / trial:** API may return **403** with upgrade hints when limits are hit — MCP surfaces the same errors.  
- **Web automation commands:** Some natural-language patterns can trigger **web automation** handling on the server (documented product behavior); treat prompts like production inputs.  
- **Context not found:** If **`context_name_query`** does not resolve uniquely, MCP returns **`error`: `context_not_resolved`** and candidate ids — narrow the query or pass **`prefer_context_id`**.
